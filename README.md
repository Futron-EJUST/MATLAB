### Course Description

MATLAB, is a programming language for algorithms development, data analysis, visualization and numeric computation. MATLAB, is provided with packages that critical for mechanical, electrical, electronics, computer science, control, mechatronics, and robotics engineering. So, understanding the MATLAB language is critical to be involved in robotics field. So, at this course we provide most of perquisites and building blocks for concurrent courses or others courses in the future.
